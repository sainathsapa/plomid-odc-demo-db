# PLOMID server runtime image.
#
# This image contains ONLY the compiled server binary. There is deliberately no
# build stage, no toolchain, no package manager cache and no source code: the
# Linux executable is produced on the build host by `make linux-binary` (see the
# Makefile) and copied in as a single artifact. End users of the image can
# therefore not read the source, and the image cannot leak build inputs.
#
# Build via `make docker` so the artifact exists first.

FROM debian:bookworm-slim

# `TARGETARCH` (`arm64` / `amd64`) is set by BuildKit for the platform being
# built, so the same Dockerfile packages either architecture.

# A container is reachable only via a non-loopback bind, which the server
# refuses without explicit secure configuration (fail closed). The image
# therefore ships NO insecure opt-in: the operator chooses one of —
#   (a) TLS (recommended): mount a certificate/key and set
#       PLOMID_TLS_CERT / PLOMID_TLS_KEY plus `--tls` (and `--tls-required`
#       to refuse plaintext entirely). See docs/v0.1.0/operations/tls.mdx.
#   (b) trusted network only: pass -e PLOMID_ALLOW_INSECURE_REMOTE=1
#       (the server logs a warning on every start) AND a unique secret via
#       -e PLOMID_PASSWORD=<secret> (the built-in default is refused on
#       non-loopback binds).
# Without one of these the server exits with a configuration error instead
# of serving credentials in the clear.
