//! The three-way answer of metadata evaluation.
//!
//! * [`PruneVerdict::Prune`] — the metadata *proves* no row in the range can
//!   satisfy the predicate. Only this verdict lets a caller skip rows.
//! * [`PruneVerdict::Keep`] — applicable metadata exists and it does **not**
//!   prove emptiness. The range may hold matches; scan it.
//! * [`PruneVerdict::Unknown`] — there was no applicable evidence at all:
//!   missing bounds, an unsupported type, a foreign column, an unsupported
//!   literal. The range may hold matches; scan it.
//!
//! `Keep` and `Unknown` both mean "scan"; they are kept distinct so callers
//! and tests can tell "the metadata looked and could not decide" from "the
//! metadata had nothing to say". Uncertainty only ever *downgrades* to a
//! scan — the combinators in [`super::predicate`] never upgrade a non-pruning
//! branch into a pruning verdict.
