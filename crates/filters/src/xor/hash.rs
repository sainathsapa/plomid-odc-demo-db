//! Deterministic key hashing for the XOR filter.
//!
//! The filter needs three independent slot indices per key and one
//! fingerprint. Rather than pull in a hashing crate, this module implements the
//! one mixer the structure requires — documented, tested, and independent of
//! the rest of the engine, so the persisted image is reproducible across builds
//! and platforms.
//!
//! ```text
//! key bytes ──fnv1a─▶ 64-bit seed ──splitmix64─▶ h0 ‖ h1 ‖ h2 ‖ fingerprint
//! ```
//!
//! `h0`, `h1`, `h2` are derived from one 64-bit value by [splitmix64]
//! iteration, so the filter's correctness never depends on the quality of an
//! external hash: the constructor verifies the built filter against every
//! inserted key before returning it.
//!
