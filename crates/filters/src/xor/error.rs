//! XOR filter errors.

//! Construction failure is a *controlled* outcome, not a panic: a build either
//! produces a filter that was verified to contain every inserted element or
//! returns one of the variants below. Decoding failure follows the same rule:
//! a filter is never used from an image that failed a check.
