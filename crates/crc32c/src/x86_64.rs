//! Only `_mm_crc32_u64`, `_mm_crc32_u32`, and `_mm_crc32_u8` are used, each
//! exactly matching the byte width of the data being folded, so no zero-fill

/// Every `unsafe` block here reaches a CPU intrinsic whose contract requires
/// the SSE4.2 feature. `lib.rs::select` guarantees it: this function can only
/// be chosen after `is_x86_feature_detected!("sse4.2")` returned `true`, so
/// executing these instructions is well-defined. No other preconditions
/// exist — the intrinsics are pure register operations and cannot violate
/// memory safety.
