//! Generic, deterministic maintenance coordination for the SQL layer.
//!
//! PLOMID materializes committed SQL state into immutable generations. That
//! work is expensive, so it must never run once per `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`.
//! This module owns the small amount of policy and accounting needed to decide
//! *when* a table is due, and nothing else.
//!
//! The design is deliberately generic rather than index-specific:
//!
//! ```text
//! committed DML
//!     ↓
//! record one committed mutation     (cheap integer increment, no I/O)
//!     ↓
//! policy says "not due" ──────────→ continue normally
//!     ↓ due
//! maintenance pass                  (the SQL layer materializes the table)
//! ```
//!
//! Index generation is not scheduled here. The maintenance pass publishes a
//! stable data generation and the existing one-authority index-generation
//! engine consumes it, so no second index scheduler exists.
//!
//! # Determinism
//!
//! The policy is driven by a committed-mutation counter that only advances on a
//! successful commit, counted in rows written (not statements): a bulk commit
//! of N rows accrues N units, a single-row commit accrues one. It uses no
//! wall-clock time, no byte counts, and no background thread, so a test can
//! drive it exactly by executing statements.
//!
//! # Default policy
//!
//! [`MaintenancePolicy::DEFAULT_COMMITTED_MUTATIONS_PER_GENERATION`] committed
//! row-mutations (64) accumulate before one table is considered due. The bound is a
//! configuration value, not a hidden constant: [`MaintenancePolicy::new`]
//! accepts any value, including `1` (materialize after every commit) for
//! systems that explicitly want that, and [`MaintenanceCoordinator`] exposes
//! the active value.
