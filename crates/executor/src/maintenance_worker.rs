//! Bounded background maintenance worker.
//!
//! Post-commit generation passes (columnar flush, compaction, index builds)
//! cost tens of milliseconds even in release builds — running them on the
//! committing connection inflates write p99 ~13× (measured 12ms → 153ms).
//! This module moves that work off the foreground commit path without
//! changing what the work does or when it is safe.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! * One dedicated thread per worker, driven by a bounded channel. Sessions
//!   submit `(database, table)` items when their policy says a table is due;
//!   the worker runs the same [`maintain_table`](crate::ddl::maintain_table)
//!   the foreground path ran, through its own engine facade and a freshly
//!   loaded catalog (so DDL-visible state is never stale).
//! * Single ownership: a process-wide in-flight set coalesces duplicate
//!   submissions — at most one queued-or-running item per table, so a write
//!   burst cannot pile up redundant full materializations and memory stays
//!   bounded by (tables × one item).
//! * Failures are non-fatal exactly like foreground passes: the item is
//!   dropped, the in-flight mark is released, and the submitting sessions'
//!   accounting still says "due", so the next commit resubmits. Nothing is
//!   lost; nothing is retried blindly.
//! * Backpressure without debt: a full channel makes `submit` return false,
//!   and the caller runs the pass inline — precisely today's foreground
//!   behavior. Overload therefore degrades to the status quo, never to
//!   unbounded accumulation.
//! * Crash safety is inherited, not reimplemented: the pass is the same
//!   WAL + atomic-publication sequence the kill-9 tests cover. A kill
//!   mid-pass recovers like a kill mid-`VACUUM`. Unprocessed queued items
//!   vanish with the process; new sessions re-derive the debt from write
//!   activity and resubmit.
//! * Shutdown is cooperative and bounded by one pass: the flag stops intake,
//!   the loop drains nothing new, and `shutdown` joins the thread. A pass in
//!   flight finishes (it is crash-safe at every boundary, so waiting is
//!   always sound).
//!
//! The worker never touches session ART (a per-session derived cache, rebuilt
//! lazily on demand) and never changes transaction, snapshot, WAL, or
//! durability behavior: foreground commits still WAL-sync before responding.
