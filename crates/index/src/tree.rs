//! The in-memory adaptive radix tree index.
//!
//! # What this is
//!
//! `ArtIndex` maps a variable-length **byte** key to one or more **logical**
//! [`RowId`] values. It is a pure in-memory structure: it owns no pages, no
//! file handles, and no durability protocol. Everything it stores is a logical
//! reference plus the key bytes needed to reach it.
//!
//! ```text
//! SQL predicate
//!       │
//!       ▼
//! ArtIndex::lookup(key)      ← candidate RowIds (no visibility decisions)
//!       │
//!       ▼
//! existing MVCC visibility rules
//!       │
//!       ▼
//! visible rows
//! ```
//!
//! ART deliberately stops at the first arrow's right-hand side. It never
//! consults a transaction id, a commit sequence number, or a snapshot: a single
//! `ArtIndex` is either private to one writer or shared read-only, and the
//! caller decides which of the returned RowIds are visible.
//!
//! # Concurrency
//!
//! Mirroring the single-writer B+Tree in `plomid-storage`
//! (`BTreeIndex::insert(&mut self, …)`), mutation takes `&mut self` and lookup
//! takes `&self`, with **no internal locking**. There is no latch, no version
//! counter, and no lock-free claim: callers must serialize mutation through
//! whatever lock the engine already holds (today the engine-level lock, or the
//! single writer that owns the index). This is the same contract the existing
//! storage index offers, so no new concurrency framework is introduced.
//!
//! # Uniqueness
//!
//! The same structure serves both index kinds. [`IndexKind::Unique`] rejects a
//! second, different RowId for a key with [`ArtError::DuplicateKey`] (mapped by
//! the engine onto its existing `PL-CONFLICT` kind); [`IndexKind::NonUnique`]
//! keeps a sorted set of RowIds per key. Constraint *policy* (when a violation
//! is reported, deferrable constraints, and so on) stays with the existing
//! planner/executor/constraint code — ART only reports the conflict.
//!
//! # Persistence
//!
//! Not implemented here, on purpose. `crates/index` depends only on
//! `plomid-core`, has no buffer-pool/page/WAL dependency, and therefore cannot
//! and does not claim crash safety or recovery. See the crate docs in `lib.rs`
//! for the exact persistence boundary and what a later phase must provide.
