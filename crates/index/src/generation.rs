//! Index generation lifecycle: build → verify → flush → sync → publish → retain → GC.
//!
//! This module is the one authoritative index-generation engine. Both triggers
//! enter the same lifecycle; neither selects a different implementation:
//!
//! ```text
//!   automatic request ──┐
//!                       ├──►  build_index_generation(trigger)  ──► one lifecycle
//!   manual request   ───┘
//!
//!   BUILD   BTreeIndex::create + insert every visible row
//!   VERIFY  reopen the payload and require the entry count to match
//!   FLUSH   stage the generation metadata image
//!   SYNC    fsync the staged record (the durability boundary)
//!   PUBLISH atomic rename; readers see old or new, never a partial record
//!   RETAIN  the superseded current generation becomes `Retained`
//!   GC      only `Retired` generations are reclaimed
//! ```
//!
//! # What this module does not own
//!
//! It owns no catalog, WAL, recovery, checkpoint, allocator, checksum, or
//! storage implementation. It reuses:
//!
//! * [`plomid_storage::DatabaseLayout`] for every path and metadata publication,
//! * [`plomid_storage::IndexGenerationMetadata`] for the durable record,
//! * [`plomid_storage::checksum`] (CRC32C) through the layout's publication,
//! * [`BufferPool`] for the persistent page storage of the B+Tree payload,
//! * [`BTreeIndex`] for the ordered structure itself.
//!
//! # Durable artifacts
//!
//! One index generation owns exactly two files inside its index directory:
//!
//! ```text
//! objects/databases/DB-*/schemas/S-*/tables/T-*/indexes/I-*/
//! ├── META.dat              index identity (existing)
//! ├── GEN-<generation>.dat  generation metadata (this module)
//! └── IDX-<generation>.dat  persistent B+Tree payload
//! ```
//!
//! Both artifacts are named by generation identity, so rebuilding an index can
//! never overwrite a generation that is still retained.
