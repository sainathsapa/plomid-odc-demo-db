//! Adaptive Radix Tree (ART) and persistent B+Tree indexes for PLOMID.
//!
//! This crate holds the index-layer abstractions that sit above the storage,
//! WAL, transaction, and MVCC subsystems (see section 2 of the architecture
//! brief).
//!
//! * `art` — an in-memory adaptive radix tree mapping byte-string keys to
//!   logical [`RowId`] references. It is intentionally independent of the
//!   storage engine, WAL, MVCC, and SQL layers (see [`ArtIndex`]).
//! * `btree` — a persistent, ordered B+Tree SQL index. It reuses PLOMID's
//!   existing page allocator ([`BufferPool`]), page format ([`Page`]), CRC32C
//!   page integrity, and WAL recovery path. It owns only the ordered key
//!   structure, node organization, and index lookup semantics (see
//!   [`btree::BTreeIndex`]).
//!
//! # Persistence boundary
//!
//! The B-tree (`btree::BTreeIndex`) is the durable authority (paged file plus
//! WAL/recovery); `ArtIndex` is a derived in-memory rebuild via
//! [`ArtIndex::rebuild_from_entries`] and claims no crash safety of its own.
//!
//! # Concurrency
//!
//! Mirroring the single-writer B+Tree in `plomid-storage`, all operations take
//! `&mut self` / `&self` with no internal locking. Callers must serialize
//! access (as the engine already does with its engine-level lock). No lock-free
//! or concurrent behavior is claimed.
