//! Leaf values: the logical RowId references stored under one key.
//!
//! A leaf either holds an empty posting list (the key is absent) or one or
//! more logical [`RowId`] values (the key is present). The same
//! representation therefore serves both index kinds:
//!
//! * **unique index** — at most one RowId per key; a second, *different*
//!   RowId is rejected as a duplicate-key conflict.
//! * **non-unique index** — many RowIds per key.
//!
//! Only logical RowIds are stored. No page id, file offset, buffer pointer, or
//! memory address ever appears here, so an ART stays valid when the storage
//! layer relocates a row.
//!
//! # Representation
//!
//! Values are kept sorted ascending. That gives deterministic iteration order
//! (useful for tests, benchmarks, and stable SQL result ordering), makes
//! duplicate detection a binary search, and keeps the common single-value case
//! to one `Vec` allocation. This is intentionally a plain `Vec<RowId>` rather
//! than a dedicated posting-list subsystem: the representation is small and
//! can be replaced (for example by page-backed lists for very hot keys) without
//! touching traversal code, because traversal only uses the methods below.
