//! One durable storage segment: an on-disk B+Tree in a device's pack directory.
//!
//! A segment is the storage engine's unit of physical growth. Its bytes live in
//! the `packs/` directory of exactly one device, so a segment is the smallest
//! unit that is *placed*: it is never split across devices, which is what lets
//! a logical table span several devices while every segment keeps a single
//! physical owner.
//!
//! The segment owns its B+Tree and exposes only key-value operations to the
//! storage manager, so placement bookkeeping in the manager never has to know
//! how a segment stores bytes.
