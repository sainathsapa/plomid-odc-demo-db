//! Transaction-aware storage engine contract for PLOMID.
//!
//! [`StorageEngine`] is the primary entry point for all higher-layer storage
//! operations. It coordinates B+Tree state, the WAL, the
//! [`TransactionManager`](plomid_txn::TransactionManager), and recovery so
//! that callers never interact with physical storage components directly.
//!
//! # V1 Read Semantics
//!
//! Reads observe the last committed B+Tree state. Uncommitted transaction
//! writes remain buffered and are invisible until [`commit`](StorageEngineTransaction::commit)
//! succeeds. Read-your-own-writes is not supported in V1; there is no MVCC,
//! snapshot isolation, or version chain.
//!
//! # V1 Write Semantics
//!
//! All writes must flow through a transaction obtained from [`begin`](StorageEngine::begin).
//! The transaction records every operation in the WAL, buffers them in memory,
//! and only applies them to the B+Tree on [`commit`](StorageEngineTransaction::commit).
//! [`abort`](StorageEngineTransaction::abort) discards buffered operations.
//!
//! # Concurrency
//!
//! V1 is single-writer. The engine and its transactions must be serialized by
//! the caller (for example, behind a `Mutex`). Concurrent access is undefined
//! behavior.
