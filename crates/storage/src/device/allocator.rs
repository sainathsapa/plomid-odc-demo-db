//! Device allocator: which physical device receives new storage.
//!
//! The allocator is the *only* component that picks a device for new physical
//! storage. It takes a [DeviceRegistry] (the set of known devices) and chooses
//! an eligible device for an allocation request. It never writes pages itself:
//! that is the physical storage layer's job — it returns a device handle so the
//! caller can allocate within that device.
//!
//! Selection is capacity-first: the device with the most free space that can
//! satisfy the request wins. This keeps large allocations on large devices and
//! avoids fragmenting small devices when larger ones are available.
