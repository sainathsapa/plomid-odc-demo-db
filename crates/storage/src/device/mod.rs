//! Physical storage devices and how logical objects are placed on them.
//!
//! A device is a *directory* inside the database root:
//!
//! ```text
//! PLOMID_DATA/devices/D-0000000000000001/
//! ├── DEVICE.dat   durable device identity and capacity
//! ├── packs/       the physical storage containers of the device
//! ├── free/        free-space accounting used by device placement
//! └── state/       device lifecycle state
//! ```
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! * `metadata` – the durable `DEVICE.dat` record (identity and capacity).
//! * `state` – the durable `state/STATE.dat` record (device lifecycle state).
//! * `registration` – materializes a device directory and validates an
//!   existing registration without ever rewriting it.
//! * `registry` – which devices exist, where they live, and how much room they
//!   have left. It resolves `DeviceId → device`, and it never chooses a device
//!   for data.
//! * `allocator` – chooses which registered device receives new physical
//!   storage. It is the only component that decides placement.
//! * `physical` – the existing lower-level device container implementation
//!   (single pre-sized device file with a persistent extent allocator). It stays
//!   authoritative for its own format and allocator.
//!
//! # One database, many devices
//!
//! Nothing here assumes a particular device: devices are discovered from the
//! layout, a database may register any number of them, and one logical table can
//! span several devices. The capacity of the database is the sum of its device
//! capacities, so a full device never becomes the limit of the database: the
//! allocator simply selects another eligible device, and reports a controlled
//! capacity error only when every device is exhausted.
