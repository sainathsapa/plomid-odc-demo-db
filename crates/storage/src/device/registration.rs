//! Device registration: materializing one device directory.
//!
//! Registering a device creates its complete durable structure:
//!
//! ```text
//! devices/D-0000000000000001/
//! ├── DEVICE.dat   identity and capacity, declared here
//! ├── packs/       physical storage of the device (container and pack files)
//! ├── free/        allocator free-space accounting
//! └── state/       lifecycle state, published as online
//! ```
//!
//! # Idempotence and identity
//!
//! Registration is idempotent and never rewrites durable state. An existing
//! `DEVICE.dat` is validated against the requested identity and capacity; a
//! mismatch is a controlled error rather than a silent overwrite, because
//! rewriting the record of a device that already holds data would change what
//! the database believes about its own physical capacity.
//!
//! A device identity is logical: it comes from the caller and is recorded in
//! `DEVICE.dat`, so the same bytes moved to another path remain the same device
//! and a renamed directory can never be mistaken for a different one.
//!
//! The device container is created here too, so a registered device is
//! immediately usable for physical placement. It is created once and reopened
//! afterwards, never truncated.
