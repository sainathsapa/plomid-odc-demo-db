//! Portable positioned (offset-based) file I/O.
//!
//! PLOMID's storage layout is position-addressable: pages, block headers,
//! pack footers and device metadata are read and written at absolute file
//! offsets, and the same file handle is shared by many readers. That makes
//! `pread`/`pwrite`-style I/O — not a `Seek` cursor — the primitive every
//! storage layer is built on.
//!
//! The standard library exposes those primitives per platform and under
//! different names:
//!
//! | operation | Unix (`std::os::unix::fs::FileExt`) | Windows (`std::os::windows::fs::FileExt`) |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | read at offset | `read_at` | `seek_read` |
//! | write at offset | `write_at` | `seek_write` |
//! | read exactly at offset | `read_exact_at` | *(not provided)* |
//! | write all at offset | `write_all_at` | *(not provided)* |
//!
//! [`FileExt`] is the crate-internal abstraction over that difference. It
//! mirrors the Unix signatures exactly — `read_exact_at`/`write_all_at`
//! included — so storage code calls `file.read_exact_at(buf, offset)`
//! uniformly and stays platform-agnostic. On Unix every method forwards to
//! the standard library's implementation; on Windows the two "exact/all"
//! methods are the standard library's documented completion loops over
//! `seek_read`/`seek_write`.
//!
//! Keeping this behind one trait means the hot paths add no work on Unix
//! (callers pay only a static dispatch) and no storage module needs
//! `#[cfg]` branches of its own.
