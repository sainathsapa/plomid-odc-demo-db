//! `CURRENT`: the durable pointer to the published state of the database.
//!
//! `PLOMID_DATA/CURRENT` records which published catalog state is authoritative
//! and which durable storage generation and WAL boundary that state describes.
//! It is the single durable authority for "what does this database currently
//! contain": readers and recovery never infer the current state from directory
//! enumeration, they read this record, validate it, and follow it.
//!
//! # Semantics
//!
//! * **Absent** means the database has never published a state. That is not an
//!   error: a new database publishes its first state through the generation
//!   manager, which creates `CURRENT` as the last step of publication.
//! * **Present** means the named state is authoritative. A record that fails to
//!   decode is corruption and is reported, never silently replaced.
//!
//! # Publication order
//!
//! A publication writes generation metadata, then the catalog state, and only
//! then replaces `CURRENT` through the shared atomic publication policy
//! (stage, flush, verify, sync, rename, directory sync). Because the pointer is
//! replaced last, a crash at any earlier point leaves the previous state
//! authoritative, and a crash during replacement leaves either the old complete
//! record or the new complete record.
//!
//! State recovery that cannot trust the pointer is owned by the generation
//! manager, which falls back to the newest valid checkpoint and the newest
//! published catalog state before giving up.
