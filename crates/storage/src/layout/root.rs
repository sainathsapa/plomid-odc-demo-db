//! Root layout of a PLOMID database directory.
//!
//! [`DatabaseLayout`] is the filesystem-layout abstraction of a database root.
//! It answers one question — *where* does durable state live — and nothing else:
//! it does not allocate storage, select devices, write pages, run transactions,
//! perform WAL or recovery work, own catalog state, or inspect physical
//! content. Those responsibilities stay with the components that own them.

// Directory and file names that several crates share (the WAL crate and the
// lifecycle coordinator write into the same tree) have one definition in
// `plomid_core::constants`; the layout re-exports them so path algebra stays
// in one place without a second copy of the same string.
